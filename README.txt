Panity is a workflow model and level editor for Panda3D
that tries to bring proven ideas from Unity3D to the open source
world. Unity3D is a great game engine with integrated editor and a very
efficient workflow. Panda3D, undoubtly one of the best OSS game engines
lacks the two features of graphical interface and fixed workflow pipeline.
A big pro of Panda in contrast is its very liberal BSD license and its
support for Linux.

Panity is made of two layers:
- API wrapper
- Level editor

The API wrapper is a collection of classes that try to mimic Unity's behaviour
in sense of code. It follows the same principal ideas and you should be able
to rewrite scripts written for Unity to Panity with little effort.

The level editor is a graphical front-end for interactive and intuitive scene
building. In big parts this tries to mix what makes Unity so intuitive.
Using wxWidgets we support all major desktop operating systems.
